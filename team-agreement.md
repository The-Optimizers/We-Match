### Planning

A 3-hour meeting for our team project was conducted to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and with a general consensus have agreed on how to handle each requirement.

## Deliverable

A public-facing GitHub repo and markdown file was created by team member Taylor to include the following components in our team agreement submission.

### 1. Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. The following is a list of areas of strength, competency and growth for each member of our team.

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

|          | Key Strength                                         | Strength Utilization                                                      | Competency Growth                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Farah   |       |  |                            |     |
| Qusai ||                                             |  |     |
| Marah    ||                                         |                              |     |

- We will take a two pronged approach to the day-to-day workflow:
  - As previously mentioned, we will start our sessions with a stand-up.
  - Secondly, we will be heavily rely upon our Kanban process and trello. 

     -     Never Pass Defective Products.
      -  Take Only What's Needed.
       +  Produce the Exact Quantity Required.
       +   Level the Production.
       +     Fine-tune the Production or Process Optimization.
       +     Stabilize and Rationalize the Process.


### 2. Conflict Plan

- To resolve conflict,we will utilize a majority rule approach. We will be open and honest about issues and concerns. We will discuss all in an open forum as a group, even if it's between two people, and then use a vote/consensus to resolve as a group. We will be able to use the logic  to mediate on potential conflicts objectively.
- If someone is taking over, this would be considered a conflict and so we would need to refer to bullet point 1 and review our work plan.
- To approach members being at different levels of understanding, doing stand ups before coding sessions will be important.

## 3. Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle our project, the following will detail how our group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort but a team effort and to make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Areas of communication concern:

- What hours will the team be available to communicate?
  - Hours will be flexible and respectful of each other's time(usually on the lab time).
- What platforms will your team use to communicate?
  - Slack for messaging
  - Github for project management.
- How often will you take breaks?
  - When working as a team the group will take breaks every hour ad-lib. We will meet between 9 am - 5pm (as need)
  - When working as individuals each person will adhere to a min/max of 2 - 5 hours while taking breaks as needed.
  - When working as individuals each person agrees to not allow themself to be overstressed.
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Each person will be open and honest on where they are within the project time 😁😁.
  - If there is ambiguity, be honest, open and ask questions or ask for help.
  - Each person will adhere the 15 minute rule
          +  The 15-minute rule calls for dividing your working hours into 15-minute sprints and allocating specific tasks within those time slots. If you have six hours of work each day, you end up with 24 slots of 15-minutes each, and so on.

  - If we recognize we're falling behind as a team we will regroup, restate and reset our priorities and aim for the(minimum viable product) MVP.
  - If necessary we will reach out to Jason or TA's for advice.
  - If our group hit a sticking point we will do the same as previously mentioned.

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - We will communicate through Slack but will still be mindful and respectful of the timing.
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  - We will conduct a group stand-up/check-in at the beginning of each coding session.
  - Before moving on we will be certain to resolve all issues heard.
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  - The Leader will stand-in as the "safe place". Each team member will have the opportunity to have private and anonymous discussion with the Leader to voice his/her concerns.
  - The Leader will address these concerns with the group as a whole.

### 4. Work Plan

Our plan to assure everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on agreed upon core problems are as follows:

- How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - We will utilize a Kanban methodology within Github for this purpose
  - The Leader will be the admin for this process
- What project management tool will be used?
  - The group have settled on using Github

### 5. Git Process

Our team’s Git workflow for coding tasks will be as follows:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - The repo will reside on Github
  - Leader will be the primary person responsible for handling all issues related to PR, gituations, etc.
  - The project workflow will be on Github
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  - Our work will be a collaborating effort and each team member will have full access to the repo.
- What is your Git flow?
  - every one from the group will clone the main repo and work on non-main branch on his/het laptop.

- Will you be using a PR review workflow?
  - yes, at the end of the coding day we'll push and pull togother.
- How many people must review a PR?
  -  the person who push will pull.
- Who merges PRs?
  - the person who pull will merge.
- How often will you merge?
  - At the end of each mob coding session or ad-lib when the code works and is not broken
- How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
  - It will be critical that when a piece of the code works it will be ACP'd.
  - it's important to have a backup after every code session.
